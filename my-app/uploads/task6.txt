The most successful pirate of all time was a woman. She commanded more men and ships than any other
pirate in history. Best of all, from her point of view, she retired undefeated, and was allowed to live peacefully
into old age.
The name of this remarkable woman was Hsi Kai. Stunningly beautiful, she was also a wily negotiator and
an organizational genius. In return for her hand in marriage, she demanded and got a 50 percent share of her
husband's wealth. Upon his death in 1807, she took complete control of the fleet.
For three years, Hsi Kai commanded more than fifty thousand men and women and more than a thousand
ships. Hers was a pirate navy larger than that of most world powers. She ruled much of the South China Sea
with an iron hand, terrorizing shipping, attacking seaside villages, and defeating every naval force sent to
attack her.
By 1810, Britain, Portugal, and China were so fed up that they assembled a combined force to attack Hsi
Kai. To avoid the massive loss of life such an assault would entail, the emperor of China offered amnesty: "If
there is anything of a woman's heart in you, you will someday want peace and offspring. Could it be now? "
She wasn't interested in children, but she knew a good deal when she saw one. Under terms she personally
negotiated with the governor general of Canton, she and seventeen thousand of her men gave up their ships
and weapons but were allowed to keep their stolen treasures. She lived another thirty years and died wealthyâ€”
nobody ever got the better of Hsi Kai.
