Do you know the indispensable part of your computer that is more than a century old?
The modern typewriter was born in the back of Kleinsteuber's Machine Shop in Milwaukee. That's where
Christopher Sholes took some piano wire and a telegraph key and built a crude typing device in 1868. It could
type only one letter, a rather fuzzy-looking w, but it was still pretty amazing for its time. Sholes and his partners
designed a more ambitious mode l with all the letters in the alphabet.
The typewriter had a problem, though. Try to type quickly on it, and the type bars banged into one another
and got stuck. The solution to that problem resulted in the keyboard we know today.
Sholes consulted with an educator who helped him analyze the most common pairings of letters in the
English language. He then split up those letters so that their type bars were farther apart and less likely to jam.
That in turn dictated the layout of the keyboardâ€”known as QWERTY, for the first five letters in the upper row.
In a manner of speaking, he slowed down the typists to prevent jamming, and thus speed up the typing.
In 1873 the Sholes & Glidden Type Writer became the first to be mass-produced, and its keyboard layout
was soon standard on all typewriters. The original Sholes & Glidden typed only capitals and was designed in
an awkward fashion that prevented the typist from looking at the paper while typing. Ads trumpeted its value
to clergymen and lawyers, but it sold quite poorly at first. One reason: it was expensive. It cost $ 125 , the
equivalent of more than $ 1,700 today.
Other keyboard layouts have been created since, and some are demonstrably more efficient, but the original
continues to thrive. It is a telling illustration of the power of inertia and the reward of being first.
