John James Audubon, nineteenth-century artist and naturalist, is known as one of the foremost authorities
on North American birds. Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied
art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of
eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.
In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount
of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business; a lumber and grist mill, a
taxidermy business, and a school. His general mode of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or
in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His
business career came to end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.
It was at that time that Audubon began seriously to pursue the dream of publishing a collection of his
paintings of birds. For the next six years he painted, birds in their natural habitats while his wife worked as
a teacher to support the family. His Birds of America, which included engravings of 435 of his colorful and
lifelike water colors, was published in parts during the period from 1826 to 1838 in England. After the success
of the English editions, American editions of his work were published in 1839, and his fame and fortune were
ensured.
